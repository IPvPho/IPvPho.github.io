# ***Manage Storage Accounts***
---
## **Azure Storage Data Objects**
---
> - Contains all Azure storage objects
> - Unique namespace access to storage resources 
>   - Ex: https://stbloblstorage001.blob.core.windows.net/demo/az-104-outline.pdf
> - Highly Available
> - Secure & Scalable

#### *Data Types:*

 - Blob
 - File
 - Queue
 - Table
 - Disk

#### *Types of Storage Accounts*

> - **General-purpose v2**
>   - All types of Azure storage data objects, supports Data Lake Gen 2 data, recommended for most use cases
> - **General-purpose v1**
>   - Legacy accounts for blobs, files, queues and tables (upgrade to v1 when possible)
> - **BlockBlobStorage**
>   - Premium performance only for BlockBlobs and AppendBlobs, useful for scenarios with low storage latency, higher transaction rates, and the data objects are smaller.
> - **FileStorage**
>   - Premium tier performance for Files, only stores files, enterprise applications or high-performance scale applications
> - **BlobStorage**
>   - Legacy Blob only storage account (use General-purpose v2 whenever possible)

### *Replication Options*

> - Local-Redundant Storage (LRS)
> - Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
> - Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)
> - Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)
> - Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
> - Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS)

*Replication Questions to ask:*

> - What if an Azure DC fails?
> - What is an Azure Regions fails?
> - Do you need Read access?

#### *Redundancy in Primary Region*

*LRS:*

> - Minimum level of redundancy for Azure 
> - Provide 3 copies of storage in a primary region
> - Single physical location / availability zone

*ZRS:*

> - 3 copies in a primary region
> - Each copy in a separate availability zone, will survive a DC outage 
> - Resiliency in a single region

#### *Redundancy in a Secondary Region*

*GRS:*

> - 3 copies in a single location
> - 3 anchored copies in a second region chosen by Microsoft (Read-Only, must be initiated after failover)
> - Protects from loss of an entire region, not from a single DC within your primary region.
> - LRS in both primary and secondary region

*GZRS:*

> - 3 copies spread across 3 AZ's in a region
> - 3 copies stored in a second region (Read-Only if primary goes offline)
> - ZRS in Primary region, LRS in secondary region
> - Will survive a DC loss in primary region, as well as primary region going offline
> - You or Microsoft must initiate failover

#### *Read Access in a Secondary Region*

> - Read-Only without Failover
> - Applications can use secondary storage
> - Available in Geo-redundant storage 
>  - Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
>  - Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS)
> - Append *-secondary* to storage account name (https://"StorageAcctName"-secondary.blob.core.windows.net)

## **Data Storage Authorization**


> - Anonymous
>   - Azure blobs only
> - Authenticated
>   - Shared Key Authorization
>   - Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
>  - Azure AD

#### *Authorizing Access to Azure Storage Data*

|                    | Shared Key (Storage Account Key) | Shared Access Signature (SAS) | Azure AD                                       | Anonymous Public Read Access |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Azure Blobs        | Supported                        | Supported                     | Supported                                      | Supported                    |
| Azure Files (SMB)  | Supported                        | Not Supported                 | *Supported using Azure AD Domain Services Only | Not Supported                |
| Azure Files (REST) | Supported                        | Supported                     | Not Supported                                  | Not Supported                |
| Azure Queues       | Supported                        | Supported                     | Supported                                      | Not Supported                |
| Azure Tables       | Supported                        | Supported                     | Not Supported                                  | Not Supported                |


#### *Shared Access Key Authorization*

> - Two Default Keys
> - Access to entire storage account
> - Protect from view (DO NOT HARD CODE)
> - Regenerate Keys through Portal or CLI
>   - Recommended to rotate keys periodically
> - Consider Azure AD instead of Shared Keys 
>   - If you use Shared Keys set them up in Key Vault as a Managed Instance


#### *Shared Access Signatures (SAS)*

- User Delegation 
  - Azure Ad credentials and permissions to the SAS (Blob only)
- Service
  - Storage Account Key, Delegates access to only one of the Azure services at a time
- Account
  - Storage Account Key, Delegates access to one or more of the storage services

- Additionally you can delegate access to read-write and delete operations within containers of blobs, tables, queues and file shares that are not permitted with a Service SAS.

### *Azure AD Authorization*

> - Supported for Blob and Queue storage
> - Uses RBAC
> - *Microsoft Recommended Approach*

#### *Accessing Resources using Azure AD*

> - Data Layer Permissions
>   - Azure storage access that allows you to access blob and queue data, storage access but doesn't allow you to navigate resources in Azure.
> - Management Permissions
>   - Allows you to naviagte resources in Azure. Assigned with Azure Resource Manager role, 'Reader' role is best suited for most restricted access while allowing read access
>   - Should be scoped at storage account or higher (Resource Group or Subscription)

### *Network Access Control*

#### *Azure Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks*

> - Layered Security Model
> - Limit Access by rules:
>   - IP Addresses
>   - IP Ranges
>   - Subnets in Azure vNets
> - Requires Authorization for applications (Azure AD or SAS Token)
> - vNets can be selected or created when allowing them access to storage accounts (creating will take roughly 15 minutes)
>   - Can add client IP Address as allowable during creating/addition process
