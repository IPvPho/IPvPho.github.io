$role = Get-AzRoleDefinition "Virtual Machine Contributor"
$role.Id = $null
$role.Name = "VM reader"
$role.Description = "Can see VMs"
$role.Actions.Clear()
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Storage/*/read")
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Network/*/read")
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Compute/*/read")\
$role.AssignableScopes.clear() 
$role.AssignableScopes.Add("/subscriptions/0000-1111-2222-aaaa-12345678")
New-AzRoleDefinition -Role $role
